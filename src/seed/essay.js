    "A family sits down for dinner. A young man plays piano. A mother patiently braids her daughter’s hair. Warm yellow windows stare back at me. Each one offers entry into simple routine nights, but they all jerk away as my train pushes forward and the conductor demands my ticket.",
    "I was adopted from foster care when I was 5. However, I have known my birth family and my mentally ill birth mother my entire life. Three times a year I travel from my home in the South Bronx to my birth family’s in Montgomery County, Maryland. The switch from the poorest congressional district in the country to one of the wealthiest, mixed with the transition between families, makes me lose my bearings. Going south, I lose my mother. Going north, I lose my grandmother, aunts, uncle and cousins. Yet the sense of loss I feel leaving one family behind is relieved by my time on the train. The journey both ways holds unparalleled meaning for me; I find peace.",
    "The train ride is my home between homes. It is a pause in the rush of the day as I am suspended between my two lives. While the train rocks steadily onward, the landscapes and buildings of each northeastern state keep me company. As the train barrels farther from the city and the blur of green and brown forest claims its territory, I find solace in the contours of the leaves and bushes. My world exists only as the length of each long brown-bodied tree, and I can find calm in their simple, easy presence. As the wheels of the train race the sun’s undeviating rays, I can be just another passenger admiring the bright afternoon. I learn to see my two families as gifts, while the junkyards of Baltimore whir past my eyes. I am reminded of how lucky I am to have two homes to go between.",
    "Maybe the family I see sitting down for dinner just attended a funeral. Maybe the man playing piano is lonely. Maybe the mother patiently braids hair so her daughter will forget her difficulties in school.",
    "Because I am surrounded by transient images of family that beg questions to be asked, I am reminded to be grateful for the variety of my own family. In Maryland, my grandmother cooks all afternoon until the kitchen is thick with scents of oil and cumin, and their perfume flows under each room’s doorway. My cousins and I sift through the attic’s fascinating content until we are greeted by the familiar smell, telling us it is dinnertime. In New York, I wait for my mom to finish the Sunday Times, and then we take the 4 train to a film at MoMA. In Maryland, we watch Bollywood movies, I eat what I am served, and I hope that I am being a fun granddaughter and cousin. In New York, I forget to cap the toothpaste and die laughing when my mom tries to dance. I can never have both families at the same time, but I can appreciate my families and be any form of myself on the train. In its liminal space, I can exist as who I am. My experience on the train moves me toward growth. I can appreciate both of my families and my own strength.",
    "While riding the train, I have grown into my own independence. I am perfectly content between my two lives and proud of the resilience I have earned. Although I give up a part of myself each way, this loss has molded who I am. This loss has gifted me with strength. I am proud of my journey and myself. I am happy with who I am becoming and where I am going. I become stronger with every minute I push farther and closer to home."
