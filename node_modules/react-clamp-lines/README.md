## Demo
[**React Clamp Lines**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-clamp-lines)

## Install
`npm install --save react-clamp-lines`

## Features
 - built for `React` with no dependencies
 - option for _&laquo;Read more&raquo;_ and  _&laquo;Read less&raquo;_ buttons
 - customizable ellipsis text
 - customizable CSS classes
 - responsive
 - window resize event `debounced` &mdash; and [why it's important](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function)
>  If your web app uses JavaScript to accomplish taxing tasks, a **debounce** function is essential to ensuring a given task doesn't fire so often that it bricks browser performance.

## Usage
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import ClampLines from 'react-clamp-lines';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
        <ClampLines
            text={text_to_clamp}
            lines="4"
            ellipsis="..."
            moreText="Expand"
            lessText="Collapse"
            className="custom-class" />
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('clamp'));
```

The component and the or _&laquo;Read more&raquo;_ button always  have the `clamp-lines` and `clamp-lines__button` CSS classes respectively. In the example above the `custom-class` will be added to `clamp-lines`, so the output will be:

```html
<div class="clamp-lines custom-class">
    <div>clamped text here...</div>
    <button class="clamp-lines__button">Expand</button>
</div>
```
